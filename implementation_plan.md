# ModuLink Implementation Plan

## Overview
ModuLink is a JavaScript library that provides a unified API for HTTP endpoints, cron jobs, and CLI commands. This document outlines our implementation plan, considerations, and questions as we integrate this library into our project.

## Current Understanding
- ModuLink creates a unified pipeline-based API across different trigger types
- Core components:
  - ModuLink instance (typically named `modu`)
  - Middleware registration via `.use()`
  - Pipeline construction with `modu.pipeline()`
  - Triggers registered via `.when` (HTTP, cron, CLI)
- Context object (`ctx`) shared across all handlers

## Implementation Questions

### Integration Questions
1. How will ModuLink fit within our existing architecture?
2. Which parts of our application would benefit most from the unified approach?
3. Should we migrate existing routes/jobs incrementally or all at once?

### Technical Questions
1. How does error handling work across the pipeline?
2. How do we handle authentication in the middleware?
3. What's the performance impact of the pipeline architecture?
4. How do we test pipelines and handlers effectively?

### Specific Use Cases
1. For HTTP endpoints: How does this integrate with our current Express setup?
2. For cron jobs: What's our current scheduling strategy and how would it change?
3. For CLI: What commands would be helpful to expose?

## Next Steps
1. Review the example code in `example/` directory
2. Create a small proof-of-concept implementation
3. Design first set of middleware functions
4. Identify first routes/jobs to convert to the ModuLink approach

## Resources
- ModuLink structure is in `modulink/modulink.js`
- Example implementation is in the `example/` directory
- Tests demonstrating usage are in `__tests__/`

This document will evolve as we make implementation decisions and discover more about how ModuLink can serve our specific needs.

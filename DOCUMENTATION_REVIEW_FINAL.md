- [x] Added Migration Guide
- [x] Created Documentation Update Summary

### 4. Key Features Now Documented
- [x] `modu.registerPipeline(name, steps)` method
- [x] `modu.execute(name, ctx)` method  
- [x] Context object structure for HTTP requests (`{ req, res, next, app }`)
- [x] Error handling patterns with `ctx.error`
- [x] Response management with `responseSent` flag
- [x] Module initialization patterns

## 📋 Documentation Quality Checklist

### Content Accuracy
- [x] All documented features exist in the implementation
- [x] Examples match actual usage patterns in the project
- [x] API method signatures are correct
- [x] Error handling patterns reflect real implementation

### Completeness
- [x] Primary API methods documented (`registerPipeline`, `execute`)
- [x] Legacy API methods documented (for backward compatibility)
- [x] Context object structure explained
- [x] Error handling patterns documented
- [x] Real-world usage examples provided
- [x] Migration path from legacy to modern approach

### Usability
- [x] Clear distinction between recommended and legacy approaches
- [x] Practical examples that developers can follow
- [x] Best practices section for guidance
- [x] Migration guide for existing users

### Organization
- [x] Logical flow from concepts to implementation
- [x] Quick Start shows both approaches
- [x] API reference is comprehensive
- [x] Real-world patterns demonstrate production usage

## 🔍 Identified Issues Resolved

### Missing Documentation (Now Fixed)
1. ❌ **Named pipeline management** - Core feature was undocumented
   - ✅ Added `registerPipeline()` and `execute()` documentation
2. ❌ **Context object structure** - HTTP request handling pattern was unclear
   - ✅ Added detailed context object documentation
3. ❌ **Error handling patterns** - `ctx.error` pattern was not explained
   - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling section
4. ❌ **Response management** - `responseSent` flag was not documented
   - ✅ Added response management documentation
5. ❌ **Real-world usage** - Examples didn't match actual project patterns
   - ✅ Added real-world usage patterns section

### Documentation Inconsistencies (Now Fixed)
1. ❌ **Legacy focus** - Documentation emphasized old trigger registration
   - ✅ Restructured to emphasize named pipelines as recommended approach
2. ❌ **Missing best practices** - No guidance on proper usage
   - ✅ Added comprehensive best practices section
3. ❌ **No migration guide** - No path for upgrading
   - ✅ Added migration guide with before/after examples

## 🎯 Final Status

**TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

The ModuLink-JS documentation has been comprehensively updated to accurately reflect the current implementation. The documentation now serves as a reliable guide for both new users (with modern named pipeline approach) and existing users (with legacy compatibility and migration guidance).

### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Accuracy**: Documentation matches actual implementation
2. **Completeness**: All major features are documented
3. **Usability**: Clear examples and best practices
4. **Structure**: Logical organization from basic to advanced concepts
5. **Future-proof**: Both current and legacy approaches documented

### Files Updated:
- `README.md` - Main documentation (comprehensive update)
- `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of changes made

The documentation is now ready for production use and accurately represents the ModuLink-JS library's capabilities.
